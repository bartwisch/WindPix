Hi and welcome to "WindPix" your picture taking Windsurf companion.
You can now easily include Screenshots in your Windsurf workflow, to give the LLM more information to fulfill your requests.

example:
1) start the app - you should see a "wind" icon in the system tray
2) work on your code with Windsurf - IMPORTANT: set focus on the cascade chat window!
3) when you want to show something to the LLM (for example a layout you want to copy or a layout bug it should fix) switch to the desired website or program you created
4) press CMD + P to open up the screenshot window to take and accept the screenshot, redo or cancel it
5) when you press "accept" the screenshot is copied to Windsurf and you can add a custom text. its also possible to add multiple screenshots into one prompt.

Notes:
- always focus on the cascade chat window or the program will paste the content to the wrong location
- give the application the needed access

this is my first approach with swift, i hope it is still useable for you!
bye,
hugo
