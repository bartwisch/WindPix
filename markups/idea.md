# Initial Idea vs Current Implementation

## Original Idea
A program for Mac that creates a screenshot with a shortcut.
The screenshot is copied to the clipboard.
Then the key combination "cmd + l" is pressed to focus the chat window in the "windsurf" program.
After a 1-second delay, the image from the clipboard is pasted into the chat window using "cmd + v".
After another 1-second delay, the ENTER key is pressed to forward the image to the LLM.

## Current Implementation
The idea has evolved into a more sophisticated application with:
- System tray presence with wind icon
- Configurable screenshot behavior (area/full screen)
- Optional chat window focus
- Screenshot preview and control panel
- Automatic Windsurf launch
- Auto-close capability
